Redis Basics
----------------------------------------------------
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is commonly used for tasks like caching, real-time analytics, messaging queues, and more. Redis supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries, and streams.

In Python, you can use Redis by installing the redis package, which provides a Python client for Redis. This client allows you to interact with a Redis server from your Python code, enabling you to store and retrieve data, perform transactions, publish and subscribe to messages, and execute various commands supported by Redis.
